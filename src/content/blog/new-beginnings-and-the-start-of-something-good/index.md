Building a fresh personal website and starting to write more has been on my todo list for longer than I care to admit. Over the past few days I finally took the plunge and built the website you see before you now using a combination of Gatsby and NetlifyCMS. I'm making a personal commitment to writing at least one new blog post a month for the rest of this year. I'm also planning to continue to evolve this website and write some more in depth case studies for some of my personal and professional projects.
