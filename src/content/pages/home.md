Hi, my name is Martin Hunt. I'm a software engineer and technology leader with over 11 years of experience building production websites, applications and high performing technical teams. I'm currently working as a Technical Lead and Development Manager at Adarga.ai where I am responsible for leading a cross functional, Agile team of 8 as well as serving as line manager for front end engineers across the organisation.\
\
I believe that technology has the power to change the world for the better and my overarching goal in life is to contribute towards that in my own small way.\
\
I believe passionately that self awareness, honesty and sincerity are the foundations of success in all facets of life, and I aim to embody these qualities in everything I do. I believe in the practice of extreme ownership and I am deeply driven to become both the best technician and leader that I can be.
