I’m a creative, people oriented and extremely driven software engineer  and technical lead with over decades worth of experience building production websites and applications. I excel at solving complex technical problems, leading efficient technical teams and creating a supportive culture centered around personal and professional growth.

I believe passionately that self awareness, honesty and sincerity are the foundations of success in all facets of life, and I aim to embody these qualities in everything I do. I believe in the practice of extreme ownership and  I am deeply driven to become both the best technician and leader that I can be.
