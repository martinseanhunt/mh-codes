title: React, Unsplash API and Automated Testing
order: 3
excerpt: A relatively straightforward React application integrated with the
  Unsplash API. The application uses the unsplash API to handle authentication
  (via Oauth) as well as searching and favoriting of images. Application state
  is managed via context and the whole application is tested using Jest &
  Enzyme. This project was an excercises in exploring best practices in testing
  ahead of creating a test strategy for Adarga.ai. The React testing landscape
  has moved on slightly since I put this project together and I now lean towards
  a more integration test heavy approach with React Testing Library.
