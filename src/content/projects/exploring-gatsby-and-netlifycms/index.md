title: Exploring Gatsby and NetlifyCMS
order: 2
excerpt: "This website (the one you're on right now) was built over a weekend
  and a couple of weekday evenings as an exploration in to using Gatsby and
  NetlifyCMS. I really enjoyed putting this one together. Although the time
  constraints, not to mention lots of designing in the browser, led to quite a
  few instances of choosing development speed over best practice /
  extensibility. NetlifyCMS will be my new go-to when a more comprehensive
  headless API based CMS like Sanity or Contentful would be overkill. "
