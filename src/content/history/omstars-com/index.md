After a little over a year of travel, which included 6 months of silent retreat, I took an extremely varied and engaging remote position as technical director for the online Yoga education platform Omstars.com.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Overseeing day to day operation and maintenance of Omstars technical platform
- Developing the Omstars FE codebase (React / SSR NextJS / Redux)
- Working closely with UI/UX to implement new designs and iterate on functionality.
- Mission critical architectural decisions
- Created and maintained various Node / Express services
- Defining technical strategy based on analysis of customer feedback, metrics and desires of stakeholders
- Building and managing a remote technical team
- Planning, coordinating and executing product roadmap and feature development
- Creating processes, practices and infrastructure for remote collaboration, communication and organisation
- Providing technical guidance on business strategy, marketing and customer retention efforts.
- Creating best practices and code standards for development, testing and deployment
- Coordinating technical collaborations and partnerships between Omstars and external companies
- Mentoring and supporting internal technical team
- Working closely with our non-technical CEO and stakeholders

**Key Achievements:**

- Facilitated greatly improved team communication and culture by introducing modern collaboration and communication tools.
- Defined and implemented numerous best practices and common processes.
- Planned and executed a full re architecture of our front end codebase using modern technologies and best practices (server side rendered React / NextJS). Coming from an Angular 1.x implementation, this drastically improved our search engine rankings, development speed and end user experience.
- Migrated development efforts from an external digital agency, to mostly in house. This significantly reduced both day to day operating costs, and cost of ongoing development, whilst increasing output and flexibility.
- Contributed to the launching of many new features and introduced new revenue streams to the Omstars platform.
- Identified and secured security vulnerabilities in both the technical platform and supporting infrastructure.
- Contributed to a growth in paying subscribers of over 45%
