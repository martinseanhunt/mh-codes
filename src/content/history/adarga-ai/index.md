After my time at Omstars I decided that I wanted to experience being part of a larger and more technically oriented organisation having mostly been a part of smaller bootstrapped startups up until this point in my career. I was immediately drawn to Adarga, as it offered an excellent environment in which to test my technical skills and gain exposure to  cutting edge technical disciplines like machine learning and AI.\
