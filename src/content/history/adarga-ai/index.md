Having, up unitl this point in my career, worked mostly within bootstrapped start ups I decided that I wanted to test myself within a larger organisation. I was immediately drawn to Adarga, as it offered an excellent environment in which to test my technical skills and gain exposure toÂ  cutting edge technical disciplines like machine learning and AI.\
At Adarga we're working with a wide variety of technologies. Our front end is built in React and tested with react testing library and cypress. We use a micro service archtechture comprising of various server side languages including Go, Python, Typescript and Java which are orchestrated by Kubernetes, Kafka and Kong gateway API.
